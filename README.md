# Viral_Tweets_Classification

In this project, I am going to use the K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm to predict whether a tweet will go viral. Before going into using the classifier, let's first consider the problem I'm trying to solve. Which features of a tweet are most closely linked to its popularity? Probably the length of the tweet strongly influences its popularity. Probably its virality is dependent on how many followers the person has.

Let's explore these options by looking at the data available:

* The total number of tweets in the dataset.
* The columns, or features, of the dataset.
* The text of the first tweet in the dataset.
